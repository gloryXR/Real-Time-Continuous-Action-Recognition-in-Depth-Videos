This repo contains the source code for the paper Real-Time Continuous Action Recognition Using the Context in Depth Videos for Smart Home, written by Hejun Wu, Biao Hu and Xinrui Zhou from Sun Yat-sen University.


##Introduce of source##
Here we uploaded two kind of programming languages.

* C++ source code (MSR_part (soon's copy_c++)/MSR)
*  Matlab source code
You can choose any kind of languages to operate our program.


##About the paper##
   We present an efficient approach for real-time continuous human action recognition with depth videos for smart home. Different from existing methods, our approach uses a discriminative frame-level descriptor, called Context Pose (CP), to integrate the context of the motion within a depth video. CP is able to increase the discriminative power of frames and allows more frames to represent actions. CP is incorporated with a new Part-based Random Decision Forest method, PRDF. PRDF is designed to automatically select the optimal combination of body parts to represent and distinguish each action. We evaluate our approach on three classical single-action benchmark datasets. Experiments show that our approach processes 200 frames/second and wins superior performances to the existing frame-level descriptors and classifiers in terms of accuracy.
